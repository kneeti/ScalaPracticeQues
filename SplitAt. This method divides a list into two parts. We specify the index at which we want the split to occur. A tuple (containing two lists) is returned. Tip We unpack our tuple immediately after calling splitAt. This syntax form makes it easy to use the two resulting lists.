//SplitAt. This method divides a list into two parts. We specify the index at which we want the split to occur. A tuple (containing two lists) is returned.
//Tip We unpack our tuple immediately after calling splitAt. This syntax form makes it easy to use the two resulting lists.

// This list contains four Booleans.
        val list = List(true, false, true, true)
        
        // Split this list at index 2 (before the third element).
        // ... This returns a tuple containing two lists.
        val (left, right) = list.splitAt(2)
        
        // Print results of splitAt.
        println(left)
        println(right)

Output
List(true, false)
List(true, true)
