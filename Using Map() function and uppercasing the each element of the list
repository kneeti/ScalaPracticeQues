//Map function. With map, we apply a function to each element in a list.
// A new list is created with the results of those function calls.
// The lambda expression uses "_" as the argument.
// Here We call map() on a string list. We call toUpperCase() on all elements, 
// and the resulting list has uppercased color names.

//A list of strings
val colors = List("red","blue","green","purple")
// Use map to uppercase all strings in the list.
        // ... The underscore is each variable encountered.
val result = colors.map(_.toUpperCase())
println(result)


Output
List(RED, BLUE, GREEN, PURPLE)
